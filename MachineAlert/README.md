Design an Alert Monitoring System.
So there are machine and sensors. The sensor can be of multiple types, Temperature/Pressure etc. So each sensor had a lower and upper threshold value, If the value goes outside this range and alert will be sent to the alert monitoring system, then a user can check it and change the state of the alert.
